# Image and Text Algorithms

## Sampled softmax
Effective noise contrastive estimation using negative sampling. The most up-to-date versions in this directory are the notebooks.

## Cross-entropy algorithms
Cross-entropy algorithms. Current the only implementation in that directory is a Multi-Layer Perceptron

## Linear regress to sum
Direct linear regression of image features to the sum of word vectors.

## Linear to hot
Direct linear regression from image features to multi-hot encoding.

## Utility functions
Utility functions. Some are related to visualization during debugging; others are related to algorithmic utility functions. For example, sampling from a distribution (i.e., negative and positive sampling.
