## Sampled Softmax
In directory sampledSM, different scripts will have different layers.

## Cross-entropy algorithms
Cross-entropy algorithms. Current the only implementation in that directory is a Multi-Layer Perceptron

## Utility functions
Utility functions. Some are related to visualization during debugging; others are related to algorithmic utility functions. For example, sampling from a distribution (i.e., negative and positive sampling.
